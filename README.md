# ImAwsum's dotfiles

## Install

>  **Warning** Be careful running scripts found on the internet!

Before executing the c script, you will need to compile it.  

This is a script to help new users configure their system to tbeir liking.  
You can use this script to install your dotfiles, update your dotfiles and configure your environment! 

Makefile is available in any version newer than 2.5

```sh
git clone https://github.com/imawsumm/dotfiles
gcc dotfiles/c-scripts/setup.c dotfiles/c-scripts/functions.c dotfiles/c-scripts/install.c dotfiles/c-scripts/update.c dotfiles/c-scripts/programs.c -o setup -Wall
./setup
``` 
note: This only compiles the code necessary for the install script. 


## after install 
Useful keybinds to know:
(super = "Windows key")
 
 super + Q -> **execute kitty**
> (the default terminal)

super + M -> **exit hyprland**

super + V -> **Toggle Floating Mode**
> ( Allows windows to stack on top of each other)

super + C -> **Close Window**


### execute programs
